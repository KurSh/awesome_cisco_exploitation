[1] Introduction
================

	This document will attempt to give a birds eye (not the peas) view of
	the platforms on which IOS runs in this release. It will give a brief
	description of the platform, indicating the development and shipping
	status, and the key differentiation of the platform.

	It is not intended to be a bible of platform information. Instead, it
	will try and be introductory in nature, and should hopefully help
	a large number of developers who need no more then a cursory knowledge
	of platform details. It will also include some pointers to more 
	information for those who want and/or need to get much more familiar
	with any given platform supported by IOS.

	Terminology :

	image 	: Cisco IOS executable
	rommon	: The Rom monitor is a piece of rom code that executes
		  when the system is powered on.
			New - More user friendly, portable monitor, sys/rommon
			Old - Original rom monitor, ../boot
	text	: The code of the image
	bss	: Uninitailzed data of the image, zeroed at init time
	boothelper : IOS image that is only capable of acting as a host.
		Primarily used for loading a full IOS image from the network
	OIR	: "Online Insertion and Removal" of cards
	flash   : Writable, non-volatile memory used for image storage

    **  The VIP1 and VIP2 are the only two production platforms that run
	IOS that are not full, standalone routers in the above list. They
	are IO controller cards that fit into the c7500 chassis and provide
	distributed functionality.

    *** There are also several unix ports that are for test purposes, that are
	not shipping images

[3] Overview of Packet Switching w.r.t Platforms
================================================

    Process Switching :

	The frame is switched by an IOS task running at process level.
	The packet is enqueued onto a process level queue by an ISR, causing
	the task to wake up and switch the frame. This is available on
	all platforms. Some (ags, c7000, c7500) use cached DRAM for the packet
	memory as the frame has to be copied by the system into a system
	packet buffer from the packet memory used by the interface controllers
	(IE from MEMD on these platforms).

    Fast Switching :

	The frame is switched by the main CPU running IOS but from within
	an interrupt service routine. This is present on all platforms.

    Autonomous Switching :

	The frame is switched by the Cbus controller. The main IOS CPU does
	not see the frame. This is only supported on boxes that have a Cbus
	controller (AGS+ and c7000).

    SSE Switching :

	The frame is switched by the Silicon Switching Engine. This is only
	available on the c7000 and it must have an SSP rather then the
	normal Cbus Controller (SP).

    IP Flow/Optimum Switching :

	The frame is switched by a special interrupt level switching
	code path on the main IOS CPU. Only the IP protocol is supported. 
	This is only available on the c7500 and c7200.
	
    Distributed Switching :

	The frame is switched by the IO card itself. This is only supported
	on the c7500 using a VIP (versatile interface processor).

c2500/IGS (Cancun) Platform Description : 
=========================================

Product Overview :

	Branch office fixed configuration router

Processor :

	Motorola 68030 at 25 Mhz

Memory/Image Architecture :

	o Unified DRAM, consisting of some soldered on memory and
	  the ability to install more memory thru a socket
	o DRAM is used for data, bss, heap and packets. It is split at
	  boot time into local CPU memory and shared IO memory. It is also
	  used for text with a run from RAM image.
	o Box is execute from flash or execute from DRAM depending
	  on which image.

	o Rom monitor (old style from boot) and a boothelper image (which
	  is run from rom) live in ROM

Supported Media :

	Ethernet, Serial, Async, BRI, Token Ring

Special Considerations :

	This platform is very sensitive to the size of non-text image
	components as typically there is plenty of flash space to hold the
	executing executable, but little DRAM space to hold data, bss and 
	allocated objects. There is a special obj directory (obj-68-c3000-boot)
	to build the boothelper image that goes into ROM that does not have
	any parser help strings to save space.

	Also this platform has many many derivatives, and has been OEM'ed
	into all kinds of other equipment.

AS5200 (Brasil) Platform Description : 
======================================
 
Product Overview :
 
        Access Server for Dialup market.  Three, non-oirable slots that
	will support one Dual PRI card (T1 or E1+modems) and two 24 modem
	cards.

Processor :
        
        68030 at 20Mhz
 
Memory/Image Architecture :
	o Split DRAM.  There is a single DRAM simm for CPU memory that is
	  used for data, bss and heap.  CPU DRAM can also be used for text
	  with an appropriately loaded (i.e. netbooted or uncompressed from
	  flash relocatable image) run from RAM image.  Minimum CPU memory
	  size is 8MB with a max of 16MB.  There is another simm for IO
	  memory, standard with 4MB but upgradable to 8MB, 16MB.
	o Platform is run from Flash but does support run from RAM but only
	  for internal debug use.
	o Images are relocatable and are stored in as well as run from
	  internal flash (recommended operation).
	o There is System flash (4, 8, 16MB) and Bootflash (4, 8, 16MB).
	o Dual Bank flash functionality is supported only for 16MB "Fiji"
	  type simms as there is only one simm slot for either Boot or
	  System flash.
	o Boothelper image is run from flash also.
	o Rom monitor is new style (ie. sys/rommon based).
 
Supported Media :
	Ethernet, Serial, PRI (E1/T1) and integrated modems.  Currently
	the modem vendor of choice is Microcom with plans to integrate
	Telebit modem technology in the future.
 
Special Considerations :
	The platform is based on the c2500 series and therefore has the
	same considerations listed for that platform.

	In addition, due to the number of possible channelized interfaces,
	CPU intensive operations are challenging on this platform.

	Also, unlike the c2500 there is no special obj directory to build
	the boot image: as5200-boot-l is built out of obj-68-as5200.

	Finally, to date there have been no OEM'ed versions of this platform.

c7000 (Clean) Platform Description : 
====================================

Product Overview :

        Modular backbone router. OIRable slots accept IO cards (known
	as Interface Processors or IP's which are compatible between the
	c7000 family and c7500 family of products). The 7000 has 5 slots 
	for IPs while the c7010 has 3 slots.  Both AC & DC power supplies 
	are available and the c7000 supports redundant power supplies. One
	slot is always taken by the RP and another is always taken by the Cbus
	Controller (also referred to as the Switch Processor or SP). There
	is also the SSE (Silicon Switching Engine which is a combined Cbus
	controller and silicon switching engine), which is also known as
	the SSP.

Processor Card :

        68040 at 40Mhz (refered to as RP)
        
Memory/Image Architecture :

        o DRAM (either 16MB or 64MB) for text, data, bss and heap.
        o SRAM for packets (known as MEMD). This memory is physically 
	  located on the Switch Processor (SP) or Silicon Switch Processor 
	  (SSP). The SP has 512 KB of SRAM, while the SSP can have either
          512KB or 2MB. This memory is not directly accessible by the main
	  CPU on the RP, however it is available thru a complicated set of
	  very smart registers on the SP (known as the sniff buffer).
        o When using autonomous or sse switching the SP/SSP switches packets
          without interaction from the RP.
        o Box is execute from DRAM only, including the boothelper.
        o Images are stored on internal flash or flash card.
        o Rom monitor (old style, boot) and a full system image (which
          can act as a boothelper) live in ROM.

Supported Media / Interface Processors :

	Ethernet	: EIP
	Token Ring 	: TRIP
	Serial		: FSIP, SSIP
	PRI/CT1/CE1	: MIP, SMIP
	IBM Channel	: CIP (Bus-and-Tag and ESCON)
	FDDI		: FIP
	HSSI		: HIP
	ATM		: AIP
        Fastethernet	: FEIP

	VIP1		: Versatile Interface Processor. This cards supports

c7200 (Predator) Platform Description : 
=======================================

Product Overview :

        Modular midrange/backbone router. OIRable slots accept IO cards
	(also known as Port Adaptors, which are compatible between the c7200
	and the VIP interface processors on the c7000/c7500). The c7206 has 
	six port adaptor slots, and the c7204 has four. Both AC & DC power 
	supplies are available and redundant power supplies are supported.

Processor Cards :

	NPE-150 : 150MHz MIPS R4700 with L2 cache and packet SRAM
	NPE-100 : Slower version of CPU, no packet SRAM

Memory/Image Architecture :

        o Unified DRAM (16MB to 128MB) for text, data, bss and heap and
	  packets. It is split into CPU memory amd IO memory at boot time.
        o SRAM for some packets. SRAM and IO DRAM can be used interchangably
	  with just a performance/bandwidth consideration.
        o Box is execute from DRAM only, including the boothelper.
        o Images are stored on internal flash ("bootflash:") or PCMCIA
	  flash cards ("slot0:" and "slot1").
        o Rom monitor (newstyle, sys/rommon) lives in ROM.

Supported Media :

	Ethernet, Fastethernet, Token Ring, Serial, FDDI.

Special Considerations :

        This platform has a MIPS RISC CPU. Please refer to the Processors 
        document for concerns and considerations. The interface device
	drivers receive packets in scatter/gather form. These frames
	cannot be directly queued to process level. They must be coalesced
	into a contigous system buffer. Also, packets that flow
	thru the IP flow/optimum switching code path are bursted into the
	CPU's internal data cache, so care is needed to keep the cache and
	physical memory coherent.

	VIP2 - 100MHz MIPS r4600, L2 cache, packet SRAM, "smart"
	       CyBus interface ASIC/DMA engine. Only supported on c7500.

Memory/Image Architecture :

        o 8-128MB DRAM (where code, data, and heap live)
        o execute from DRAM only. No boothelper.
        o Images are stored on the master CPU for the box IE RP or RSP.
        o Rom monitor (newstyle sys/rommon) lives in ROM.

Supported Media / Port Adaptors :

	Ethernet	: 4E, 8E, 5E-FL
	Token Ring 	: 4R
	Serial		: 4T
	FDDI		: 1FDDI
        Fastethernet	: 1FE

Special Considerations :

        This platform has a MIPS RISC CPU. Please refer to the Processors 
        document for concerns and considerations. Also, the VIP cards
	run a small subset of IOS functionality. No packet processing
	happens at process level. Everything is in the fastswitched path.
