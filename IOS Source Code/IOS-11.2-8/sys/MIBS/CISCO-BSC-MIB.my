	DESCRIPTION
		"The MIB module for BSC.

   Overview of BSC MIB
  
   MIB description
   
   The BSC MIB provides the configuration and operational information 
   on Cisco's Binary Synchronous Communications implementation.  The 
   following entities are managed:
    1) BSC ports (serial interfaces)
    2) BSC Control Units (stations on a port)
  
   The BSC ports are identified by the interface index, and additional 
   information about this interface can be obtained from the Cisco Serial 
   Interface MIB.  
   The BSC Control Units are identified by the Control Unit address; this 
   is the address used by BSTUN to route the BSC traffic - it is therefore 
   equivalent to the bstunRouteStationAddress in the bstunRouteTable MIB.

    SYNTAX INTEGER { primary(1), secondary(2), contention(3) }
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The router's DLC role to the attached node.
         (If the bscPortRole is primary, this implies that
         the port is connected to a remote secondary device.)"

bscPortPause OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX INTEGER (0..255)
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "For primary, it is the minimum time to be taken 
         for a cycle round the active poll table; if this 
         time has not elapsed when the bottom of the poll 
         table is reached, then polling will pause until 
         this timer expires. A value of zero means there 
         will be no pause between cycles round the poll 
         table. 
         For secondary, the pause time out is the delay 
         taken before sending a response to a poll 
         when it has no data frame to send.
         The units are tenths of a second.  The default
         is 10 (1 second)."

         the time that the primary will wait for a response
         to a poll or select.  The units are tenths of a second.
         The default is 10 (1 second)."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the number of times that a recovery sequence
         will be retried before the connection is considered
         to have failed.  The default is 5."

         interface with an unsupported control unit 
         address.  If this value is non-zero it indicates
         a problem in the configuration."

bscPortSoftErrors OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX Counter32
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Count of soft errors; these are errors 
         which have been recovered.  This includes
         CRC errors received, frames which were
         retransmitted for any reason (NAK received
         or the wrong ACK received), etc.  This count
         is a measure of the quality of the port/line,
         but should be considered in relation to the
         amount of traffic on the port (frames
         or bytes sent and received).
         This count includes all control unit soft
         errors on this port, plus errors which were
         not for a specific control unit."
    ::= { bscPortEntry 8 }

bscPortHardErrors OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX Counter32
    MAX-ACCESS read-only

    DESCRIPTION
        "Count of hard errors; these are errors which 
         have not been recovered after bscPortRecoveryRetries
         number of retries, and therefore the connection 
         has been terminated.
         These errors could be caused by a hardware error
         in the line or in the remote device; or possibly
         the bscPortRecoveryRetries value is set too low 
         for the quality of the line.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Count of protocol violations.  This counter is
         incremented when an unexpected BSC Data Link Control 
         character is received from the remote device; that
         is, the control character is invalid in the current
         state of the local BSC FSM.
         This indicates that there is an incompatibility
         between the two implementations of the BSC protocol.
