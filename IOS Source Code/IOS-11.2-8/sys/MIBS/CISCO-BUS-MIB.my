 busElanName OBJECT-TYPE

	MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION
		" A unique identifier  for this particular BUS on this
		ELAN. This value must remain  constant while the entry
		is in existence	and during the  operation of the agent
		(i.e.   It is allowed to change  after  reboot).  For 
		implementations that do not support  more than one BUS
		entity per ELAN per device, it is sufficient to always
		report 1 for this object and  only to accept the value
		1 for row creation."
	::= { busEntry 2 }

 busAtmAddrSpec OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX     AtmLaneAddress
	MAX-ACCESS read-create
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION
		" The specified ATM address of the BUS on the interface
		of interest.  Note  that setting this object will have
		the side effect   of   reinitializing  the  BUS    and
		consequently dropping all clients connected to it.  If
		this object is not specified at row creation time then
		the BUS will choose a value  for itself and attempt to
		register  with the  switch  with  that  value.  If  an
		address is  specified  which is not acceptable  to the
		switch   then the busOperStatus  will remain  inactive
		until an acceptable address is set."

 busAtmAddrMask OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX     OCTET STRING (SIZE (0 | 20))
	MAX-ACCESS read-create
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION
		"   An    address mask  that     when  used  with  the
		busAtmAddrSpec, specifies  the portion of the BUS' ATM
		address  that is desired  to be  configured. Note that
		setting    this     object   will   result   in    the
		reinitialization of the BUS, consequently dropping all
		clients connected to  it.   At row creation  time this
		object  cannot be set  without also  supplying a value
		for  the busAtmAddrSpec.  If   the BUS ATM  address is
		omitted at creation time then this object defaults to
		the  value of all  zeros  (none of the  busAtmAddrSpec
		value   is  relevant).  If the    BUS  ATM address  is
		specified  at creation time   but this object omitted,
		then this object  defaults  to the  value of all  ones
		(all of the busAtmAddrSpec is relevant)."

 busAtmAddrActl OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX     AtmLaneAddress
	MAX-ACCESS read-only
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION

	::= { busEntry 5 }

 busIfIndex OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX     Integer32
	MAX-ACCESS read-create
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION
		"  The interface that a BUS will forward traffic over.
                The value specified for this object must equate to a
                value of ifIndex in the ifTable.  The interface  will
                be for that particular ATM port (the physical
                interface, not a logical layer on top of it). This
                object can only be specified upon row creation and
                cannot be altered there after." 
	::= { busEntry 6 }

 busSubIfNum OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX     Integer32
	MAX-ACCESS read-create
	STATUS     current
	DESCRIPTION
		" Specifies   the  sub-interface number that  the  BUS
		will reside on.  This sub-interface may be shared with
		a LEC or BUS of the same ELAN  but is not required to
		do  so.  If no value  is  specified for this object at
		row creation time, then a sub-interface will be chosen
		by  the agent. This   object may only be  specified at
		row creation time and cannot be altered thereafter."

		"  This object  reflects the actual   state of the BUS
		which may  differ  from  that  of  the  busAdminStatus
