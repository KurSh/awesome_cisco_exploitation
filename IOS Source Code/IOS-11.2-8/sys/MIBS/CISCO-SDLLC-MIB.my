	DESCRIPTION
		"This is the MIB module for objects used to manage SDLLC.

   Overview of SDLLC conversion MIB
   
  
   MIB description                        
   The SDLLC MIB includes read-only configuration and operational
   information on Cisco's implementation of SDLC to LLC2 media
   translation.  The following example shows the entities managed
   by the SDLLC MIB.
  
  
    FEP/ ==  Token == CISCO A == WAN/RSRB == CISCO B == Serial == SDLC  
    Host     Ring                                       line      station
  
     |=============== LLC2 session ============|=== SDLC session ====|
     
     In this example configuration, CISCO B is performing the SDLLC 
     conversion, and so we query CISCO B for this MIB.
     The SDLC device believes it is talking to the host via a direct
     SDLC session.  The host believes it is talking to the SDLC station on 
     the same token ring.  CISCO A is also unaware of the SDLLC conversion
     going on at CISCO B; it just believes it has an RSRB session with 
     its peer CISCO B to bridge two token ring separated by a WAN.
     So CISCO B is the only agent that can provide the SDLLC conversion
     details.  We can combine this MIB with the CISCO-RSRB-MIB from
     either CISCO A or CISCO B to get a better picture of the network.
     
     There is a table entry in the MIB for each serial interface and
     sdlc address pair.  The above configuration would have a single
     table entry.  If CISCO B had two serial lines configured for
     sdllc conversion, there would be two table entries.  If there
     were only one serial line, but it was multipoint and
     supported two sdlc addresses on the other end of the 
     line, there would also be two table entries.
     
     The MIB provides the following information for each table entry:
     
     convSdllcPortPartnerMacAddr - The MAC address of the FEP, as
       specified with the sdllc partner command.
       
     convSdllcPortLlc2Ring - The token ring number on the LLC2 session
       side.  In this case it is the RSRB virtual ring group number
       between CISCO A and CISCO B.  
     convSdllcPortBridge - The bridge number assigned to CISCO B 
     convSdllcPortIndex - The interface index of the serial interface
       of CISCO B configured for sdllc conversion
     convSdllcPortVirtRing - The locally administered token ring number
       assigned to the serial interface.  This gives the serial interface
       a token ring appearance to the llc2 side of the conversion, so
       that it appears that it is a token ring on the other side of
       a bridge.
     convSdllcPortVirtMacAddr - The locally administered MAC addressed
       assigned to the serial interface.  Note that this address must
       always end in '00'.  CISCO B replaces the 00 with the sdlc
       address of the serial device.  For a multipoint configuration
       with two SDLC stations the llc2 side will 'see' two token ring 
       stations with unique MAC addresses on the sdlc side.
     convSdllcPortSdlcAddr - The address of the SDLC station.
     convSdllcPortXID - The IDBLK and IDNUM of the SDLC station;
       these must match the VTAM configured values
     convSdllcPortLocalAck - indicates whether local acknowledgement
       of SDLLC sessions is active.        
     convSdllcPortLocalAckState - indicates the state of
      the local acknowledgement session.   
     convSdllcPortConvState - indicates the state of the SDLLC conversion      
     convSdllcPortMaxLlc2FrameSize - the largest I-frame size that
       can be sent or received on the LLC2 session.
     convSdllcPortMaxSdlcFrameSize - the largest I-frame size that
       can be sent or received on the SDLC session.
