                The PU and LU MIB are defined in RFC 1666. This MIB provides
                additional information on IP and LU mapping. The following 
                entities are managed:
       
                1) TN3270S Global
                2) TN3270S Stats on Listen IP/Port basis
                3) TN3270S PU
                4) TN3270S IP to LU Mapping
                5) TN3270S LU to IP Mapping
