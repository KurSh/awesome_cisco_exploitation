All the files in this directory are part of the binary interface
between APPN and the rest of the IOS. If you change anything in here,
it may require that changes be made in the appn code itself, or that
the appn code be recompiled. 

If you feel the need to change anything here, and you don't have
access to the appn code itself, please send e-mail to the alias
"appn-code" and someone who does have access to the code will help you
out.
