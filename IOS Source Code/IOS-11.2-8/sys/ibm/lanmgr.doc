Section: INTRODUCTION

Lan Network Manager (LNM), formerly called Lan Manager, is an IBM
product for managing a collection of source route bridged token rings.
it directly manages its local token ring, and works in conjunction
with the IBM bridge program to manage all other rings in the bridged
network.  In this arrangement, the bridge provides a proxy /
translation / information gathering service to the bridge.  Any time
LNM wants information about a station somewhere on a token ring, it
asks the question of one of the brides connected to that ring using a
proprietary protocol.  The bridge either already knows the requested
information, or it will query the station for the information using a
protocol published in the 802.5 specification.  The responses, whether
from internal information or an external station, is then wrapped up
in the proprietary protocol and transmitted back to LNM.

A good analogy to this would be a language translator who translates
questions from French into German, and then translates the responses
back from German into French.  If the translator already knows the
answer to a question, then he does not bother asking the question in
German, but simply answers with the information he already knows.

Other capabilities present in the IBM Bridge Support for LNM include
asynchronous notification of some events occurring on a token ring.
Two examples of this would be the notification of a new station
joining the token ring, or of the ring going into a failure mode known
as beaconing.  Support is also provided for LNM to change the
operating parameters in the bridge.  [For a complete description of
Lan Network Manager, please refer to the product manual supplied by
IBM with the Lan Network Manager program.

This proprietary protocol used for LNM and the bridge to communicate
is a non-routeable protocol based on top of an LLC2 connection.
Because this protocol is non-routeable, LNM cannot monitor or manage
anything behind a pure router.  It can see things behind a
router/bridge, either by communicating with an IBM bridge behind the
router/bridge, or by communicating with the router/bridge itself.
This last case assumes that the router/bridge supports the LNM to
Bridge protocol, and is currently configured as a source-route bridge.

The cisco router now understands the proprietary protocol used for LNM
and the bridge to communicate.  It will provide all of the functions
currently provided by the IBM Bridge program.  This means that the LNM
can "link" to a router as if it were an IBM Bridge, and manage or
monitor any token ring connected to the cisco router.


Section: CONFIGURING THE ROUTER

Configuring a cisco router/bridge for LNM support is extremely simple.
It happens automatically as a part of configuring the router to act as
a source-route bridge.  There are several commands available to modify
the behavior of the LNM support, but none of them are necessary for it
to function.

Because there is now more than one way to remotely change parameters
in a cisco router, some way was needed to prevent them from
detrimentally interacting with each other.  The global configuration
command LNM SNMP-ONLY will prevent any LNM stations from modifying
parameters in the cisco router.  It does not affect the ability of LNM
to monitoring events, only to change things.  The syntax of this
global command is:

	lnm snmp-only
	no lnm snmp-only

LNM has a concept of reporting links, and reporting link numbers.  A
reporting link is simply a connection (or potential connection)
between a LRM and a Bridge.  A reporting link numbers is a unique
number used to identify a reporting link.  An IBM bridge allows four
simultaneous reporting links, numbered 0 through 3.  Only the LRM
attached on the lowest number connection is allowed to change any
parameters, and then only when that connection number falls below a
certain configurable number.  In the default configuration, the LRM
connected through link 0 is the only LRM allowed to change parameters.
The interface subcommand to change this parameter is LNM ALTERNATE.
The syntax for this interface subcommand is:

	lnm alternate <number>
	no lnm alternate

The number parameter must be an integer between 0 and 3.  Setting
number to 0 is the same as using the "no" form of the command, and is
the default configuration.  Setting this parameter on one interface in
a source route bridge will cause it to appear on the other interface
of the bridge.  This is because the command applies to the bridge
itself, and not to either of the interfaces.

Each reporting link has its own password.  This is used not only to
prevent unauthorized access from an LRM to a bridge, but also to
control access to the different reporting links.  This is important
because of the different abilities associated with the various
reporting links.  The syntax of this interface subcommand is:

	lnm password <number> <string>
	no lnm password <number>

The number parameter identifies which reporting link to apply the
password command.  In order to maintain compatibility with LNM, the
parameter string should be a six to eight character string containing
only letters, numbers, or the characters @, #, $, or %.  The "no" form
of this command returns the password to its default value of
"00000000".


SubSection: Configuring Servers

As in an IBM bridge, the cisco router will provide several functions
that gather information from a local token ring.  All of these
functions are enabled by default, but may be disabled by a
configuration command.  The syntax of these interface subcommands is
as follows:

	lnm crs
	no lnm crs

	lnm rem
	no lnm rem

	lnm rps
	no lnm rps

The first of these services is the Configuration Report Server (CRS).
This services keeps track of the current logical configuration of a
token ring, and reports any changes to LNM.  It also reports on
various other activities such as the change of the Active Monitor on a
token ring.

The second service is the Ring Error Monitor (REM).  This services
monitors errors reported by any station on the ring.  It also monitors
whether the ring is in a functional state, or in a failure state.

The third service is the Ring Parameter Server (RPS).  This service
insures that all station on a ring are using a consistent set of
reporting parameters, and reports to LNM when any new station joins a
token ring.


SubSection: Changing Reporting Timers

The router will send a message to all attached LNMs whenever it begins
to drop frames.  The threshold where this report is generated is a
percentage of the number of frames dropped compared to the number of
frames forwarded.  This threshold is configurable, and defaults to a
value of 0.10%.  The threshold is entered as a single number
expressing the percentage loss rate in hundreths of a percent.  The
syntax of this interface subcommands is as follows:

	lnm loss-threshold <number>
	no lnm loss-threshold

All stations on a token ring notify the Ring Error Monitor when they
detect errors on the ring.  In order to prevent excessive messages,
error reports are not sent immediately, but are accumulated for a
short period of time and then reported.  A station will learns this
value from a cisco router (configured as a source route bridge) when
it first enters the ring.  This value is entered as the time interval
in tens of milliseconds between error messages.  The negative form of
the command restores the timer value to its default of 200, or 2
seconds.  The syntax of this interface subcommands is as follows:

	lnm softerr <number>
	no lnm softerr



Section: CONFIGURING LAN NETWORK MANAGER

Configuring LNM is a fairly simple task, and is well covered in the
LNM documentation.  What may not be so simple is figuring out what
information to enter into LNM, especially when there is a virtual ring
involved.  The basic problem extends from the fact that LNM is
designed to only understand the concept of a two port bridge, and the
cisco router with a virtual ring is a "multi-port" bridge.  The
solution is to configure a virtual ring into LNM as a series of two
port bridges.  The exec command SHOW LNM CONFIG will provide all the
information necessary to configure these bridges into LNM.


For example, you have a router with two token rings configured as a
local source route bridge.  The configuration file, physical
configuration, and logical configuration appear as follows.

	!
	interface TokenRing 0
	source-bridge 1 2 3
	!
	interface TokenRing 1
	source-bridge 3 2 1
	!


          ^     +---------+     ^

         \ /    |  2  |    \ /
          v     +-----+     v

Entering the SHOW LNM CONFIG command will display the logical
configuration of the bridge, including all the pertinent information
for configuring this router into LNM.

For a more complex example, you have a router with three token rings
configured as a multiport bridge.  The configuration file, physical
configuration, and logical configuration appear as follows.

See the SHOW LNM STATION command for a description of the fields in the
bottom half of the command output.

The same exact information can be obtained by specifying a the ring
number assigned to a token ring instead of specifying the interface
number.  To do this you would enter this command at the EXEC prompt:

Section: DEBUGGING LNM SUPPORT

Use the debugging commands in this section...

    debug lanmgr-events

	Display any unusual events that occur on a token ring.  This
	includes such thins as stations reporting errors, error
	thresholds being exceeded, etc.

    debug lanmgr-llc

	Display all communication between the cisco router/bridge and
	the LNMs that have connections to it.  One line is displayed
	for each message sent or received.

    debug lanmgr-mac

	Display all management communication between the cisco
	router/bridge and all stations on the local token rings.  One
	line is displayed for each message sent or received.



Section: CAVEATS

There are two parameters in an IBM bridge that have no corresponding
parameter in the cisco router.  This means that any attempt to modify
these parameters from LNM will fail with an error message.  The LNM
names of these two parameters are the "route active status" and the
"single route broadcast mode."
