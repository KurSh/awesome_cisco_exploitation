COM101 -- PROCEDURE DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   The service reached does not support the type of Remote  
   Procedure Call on which this error is returned.  This  
   can happen when a client issues a call that specifies  
   the IPCPORT of a service other than the one with which  
   the client is supposed to communicate.  
  
COM102 -- VERSION NUMBER OUT OF RANGE.  
  
   This error code is returned on a Remote Procedure Call  
   to a service that doesn't support this version.  This  
   can happen when a client issues a call that specifies  
   the IPCPORT of a service other than the one with which  
   the client is supposed to communicate.  
  
COM103 -- TOO MANY CALLS OUTSTANDING.  
  
   The service reached was busy processing other requests and  
   couldn't handle any more.  This can happen during peak  
   traffic periods for the service, but if it occurs  
   consistently, there may be a problem with the service.  
  
COM104 -- OUT OF HEAP SPACE.  
  
   The tasking system within the service could not obtain  
   sufficient memory to perform the request.  If this error  
   occurs consistently, there may be a problem with the service.  
  
COM121 -- TASKING SYSTEM IS NOT INITIALIZED.  
  
   A tasking system call was made before the inittasking call.  
  
COM122 -- TASK STACK SIZE IS TOO SMALL.  
  
   A task has a stack size that is smaller than the minimum  
   amount necessary for a task on this machine.  
  
COM123 -- TASKING SYSTEM IS OUT OF HEAP SPACE.  
  
   The tasking system could not allocate any more memory to  
   handle a new task.  For example, an application written  
   with the VINES Application Toolkit does not free memory  
   that is no longer needed.  
  
COM151 -- BAD SOCKET DESCRIPTOR.  
  
   A socket call was made with an invalid socket descriptor.  
   Socket descriptors are returned by the sosock and  
   initdaemon calls.  
  
COM152 -- ADDRESS ALREADY IN USE.  
  
   An attempt to open a well-known port that was already  
   open on this machine was made.  
  
COM153 -- INVALID OPERATION.  
  
   An attempt to perform an invalid operation was made.  
   For example, more than four vectored I/O structures were  
   specified in a send or receive request.  
  
COM154 -- USER ADDRESS PARAMETER FAULT.  
  
   This is returned when an address specified in  
   a UNIX socket call is not in the address space  
   of the user process.  
  
COM155 -- NET/HOST UNREACHABLE.  
  
   The destination specified in the IPCPORT is not known  
   to the server acting as the communications router.  The  
   destination may be unreachable for the following reasons:  
  
   -  The destination may be off the network.  
  
   -  The destination may be unreachable due to network  
      problems such as link or router failures.  
  
   -  A process supplied an invalid destination address in  
      the IPCPORT.  
  
COM156 -- MESSAGE OVERFLOW ERROR.  
  
   On an IPC send request, the message size exceeded the  
   limit.  On a receive request, the incoming message was  
   larger than the receive buffer space.  
  
COM157 -- DESTINATION SOCKET DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   The destination machine specified in the IPCPORT was  
   reached, but no socket was open on the port.  
  
COM158 -- ADDRESS FAMILY DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   The address family field in a sosock call was invalid.  
  
COM159 -- SOCKET TYPE DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   The socket type requested in a sosock call was invalid.  
  
COM160 -- PROTOCOL DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   The protocol requested in a sosock call was invalid.  
  
COM161 -- NO MORE SOCKETS AVAILABLE.  
  
   Reconfigure the PC or server to add more sockets.  
  
COM162 -- NO BUFFER SPACE AVAILABLE.  
  
   The communication layer did not have enough memory space  
   to process the request.  This error can result from local  
   conditions, which include a temporary heavy communication  
   load, a communications buffer size configured at too low  
   a value, or wasteful use of socket calls.  You may need  
   to increase the communications buffer size for the server  
   or PC, or close unneeded sockets.  
  
   A process can also receive this error when sending data  
   to a process whose input buffer is full.  The receiving  
   process in this case is too busy to handle the data flow.  
   You should retry the request later.  If the condition  
   persists, the receiving process could be hung.  
  
COM163 -- TIMEOUT EVENT.  
  
   The time limit on a socket receive or wait request expired  
   before a message was received.  
  
   This error also occurs when a reliable IPC send request  
   does not complete within a reasonable amount of time.  
   Each Remote Procedure Call also uses a similar time limit  
   for receiving the reply.  The call returns this error  
   if the service takes too long processing the request.  
  
COM164 -- OPERATION NOT SUPPORTED.  
  
   Vectored I/O was requested on a socket type that does not  
   support vectored I/O.  
  
COM165 -- RESOURCE NOT AVAILABLE.  
  
   A serial communications line was not available or was  
   specified incorrectly.  Specify the line number again.  
   If this action fails, check the configuration of the  
   serial communications card to which the line is connected.  
  
COM166 -- INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE.  
  
   An internal failure occurred.  Reload the software on the  
   serial communications card.  
  
COM167 -- CONTROLLER RESET FAILED.  
  
   A communications driver on the server failed to  
   successfully perform a hardware reset of a communications  
   card.  This problem can result from a hardware failure  
   or a bad card configuration parameter such as an incorrect  
   I/O address.  To check card configuration parameters,  
   go to the server console, choose "System Maintenance,"  
   and select "Configure Server" from the System Maintenance  
   Menu.  Then choose "Add/Change Card Configuration."  The  
   next screen that appears displays the card configuration.  
  
COM168 -- NETWORK INTERFACE BUSY.  
  
   This message appears in DOS environments only.  A  
   terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program failed to  
   successfully submit requests to the socket interface  
   to the VINES communications system.  If this error  
   persists, reboot the PC.  
  
COM172 -- ADDRESS RESOLUTION FAILURE.  
  
   A service node (server) has not assigned a client  
   node (PC) a VINES internet address.  This situation  
   occurs when all servers that are neighbors of the PC  
   on the PC's LAN are down.  Two nodes are neighbors when  
   they share the same physical medium.  
  
COM173 -- REQUEST TERMINATED BY USER.  
  
   A process running under UNIX (for example, a service)  
   receives a UNIX KILL signal while the process has socket  
   send or receive requests outstanding.  This results in the  
   outstanding requests being torn down.  This message is not  
   common.  It can result from an administrator killing the  
   process from the server console.  
  
COM174 -- PROTOCOL RESET OCCURRED.  
  
   A protocol reset occurred on an SDLC or BISYNC line.  
   This reset is a normal function of the SDLC and BISYNC  
   protocols and should require administrative action unless  
   the message coincides with the disruption of communication.  
   The problem tends to result from typical events such as the  
   IBM host resetting the connection.  For example, on SDLC  
   lines, the host can send a Set Normal Response Mode (SNRM)  
   command.  
  
COM175 -- PROTOCOL DISCONNECT OCCURRED.  
  
   A protocol disconnection occurred on an SDLC or BISYNC  
   line.  This disconnection is a normal function of the  
   SDLC and BISYNC protocols.  This message results from  
   events such as the IBM host on the other side of the  
   connection going down.  
  
COM176 -- MESSAGE ABORTED BY USER.  
  
   An aborted socket request was issued by an application.  
   If the request was aborted by a NetBIOS application,  
   this message was remapped to a NetBIOS error.  
  
COM177 -- RESOURCE DISCONNECTION ERROR.  
  
   VINES SPP terminated an SPP virtual connection.  Causes  
   involve serial line or LAN failures, lack of sufficient  
   communications buffers, or an insufficient limit on the  
   number of concurrent SPP connections.  Communications  
   buffers and SPP connection limits can be increased from  
   the server console.  See the Server Operations Guide for  
   more information.  
  
   This message may also appear during termination of a TCP  
   connection.  Causes involve serial line or LAN failures,  
   or lack of sufficient communications buffers.  Other  
   causes are related to the TCP/UDP toolkit.  
  
COM250 -- IP HOST IS DOWN.  
  
   The destination IP host is either down or off the  
   network.  You must wait for the host to come up or  
   come back on the network before you can communicate  
   with it.  
  
COM251 -- IP NETWORK IS DOWN.  
  
   The network in which the destination IP host resides  
   cannot be reached.  The gateway to the network may be  
   down, or there may be problems with the physical links  
   along the path to the network.  
  
COM252 -- IP HOST IS UNREACHABLE.  
  
   No route was defined to the destination host.  Your  
   network administrator must use the TCP/IP configuration  
   program to set up a route.  See the TCP/IP Option Guide  
   for information on setting up routes.  
  
COM253 -- IP NETWORK IS UNREACHABLE.  
  
   No route was defined to the destination network.  This  
   error message occurs on a TCP sosend of type SO_CONNECT  
   or a UDP sosend of type SO_DATA.  It indicates that no  
   route is defined to the destination network.  The network  
   administrator must use the TCP/IP configuration program  
   to set up a route.  See the TCP/IP Option Guide for  
   information on setting up routes.  
  
COM254 -- PORT UNREACHABLE.  
  
   The destination port was not reached due to network  
   problems, or because the port address was incorrectly  
   specified.  The application should attempt to connect  
   to the destination port later.  
  
COM255 -- ROUTE ALREADY EXISTS.  
  
   An attempt was made to create a route that already existed.  
   Create a unique route to the destination.  
  
COM256 -- ADDRESS NOT AVAILABLE.  
  
   When this error message occurs on a TCP sosend of type SO_CONNECT  
   or a UDP sosend of type SO_DATA, an application attempted to  
   connect to a destination process over a local IP interface for  
   which the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) was disabled.  
   The network administrator must use the TCP/IP configuration  
   program to enable ARP for the interface or to create an ARP  
   entry for the destination.  This error message can also mean  
   that a port number of 0 was specified in the port address  
   of the destination port.  You must use a port number other than 0.  
  
   When this error message returns on a sosend of type SO_BIND, it  
   indicates that either an attempt was made to bind a local port  
   address containing an invalid IP address to a socket or that  
   the address family was incorrect.  
  
COM257 -- ACCESS TO INTERFACE NOT ALLOWED.  
  
   The application attempted a broadcast without first  
   setting the SO_BROADCAST option for the socket.  This  
   error message occurs for UDP applications only.  Before  
   an application can issue a broadcast, it must issue  
   sosend of type SO_SETSOCKOPT and enable the SO_BROADCAST  
   option.  
  
COM258 -- FOREIGN ADDRESS ALREADY CONNECTED TO.  
  
   This error message occurs on a sosend of type SO_CONNECT  
   on a TCP socket that was already connected, or on a UDP  
   socket that was set up for dedicated datagram exchanges  
   with another UDP socket.  An application should not issue  
   sosend of type SO_CONNECT while the socket is connected  
   or involved in dedicated datagram exchanges.  To issue  
   another sosend of type SO_CONNECT, the application must  
   first terminate the TCP connection or UDP dedicated  
   datagram exchange.  
  
   This error message also returns on a sosend of type  
   SO_SETSOCKOPT, which the application issues after a  
   sosend of type SO_CONNECT.  Options should be set for  
   a socket prior to issuing sosend of type SO_CONNECT.  
  
COM259 -- FOREIGN ADDRESS NOT CONNECTED TO.  
  
   This error message occurs when a sosend of type  
   SO_DISCONNECT is issued on a socket that is not  
   connected or involved in a dedicated datagram exchange.  
   Sosend of type SO_DISCONNECT can only be issued following  
   a connection or a dedicated datagram exchange.  
  
   This error message also returns when an attempt is made  
   to send or receive data on a TCP socket that is not connected.  
   Sosend of type SO_CONNECT must be issued on TCP sockets  
   before data can be sent or received.  
  
COM260 -- CONNECTION REFUSED BY PEER.  
  
   The peer TCP software sent a TCP reset message during the  
   connection attempt, refusing the connection.  This error  
   message occurs on a sosend of type SO_CONNECT on a TCP  
   socket.  Re-issue a sosend of type SO_CONNECT, but this  
   does not guarantee that the connection will be established.  
   The peer TCP software decides when you can connect and when  
   you cannot.  
  
COM261 -- CONNECTION RESET BY PEER.  
  
   The peer TCP software abruptly reset the connection.  
   This error message occurs on pended sosend and sorec  
   requests.  

VPS501 -- YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRINT SERVICE SPECIFIED.  
  
   You tried to access a print service to which you have no  
   access rights.  To obtain access rights, see your system  
   administrator.  
  
VPS502 -- PRINT QUEUE SPECIFIED DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   You specified a print queue that does not exist, or you  
   made a typing error.  Try again or see your system  
   administrator for the correct name.  
  
VPS505 -- PRINT JOB SPECIFIED DOES NOT EXIST.  
  
   Either you specified a print job that was not included in  
   the print queue, or the job was removed from the print queue.  
   To refresh your display, wait for your screen display to be  
   updated, or exit the utility and try again.  
  
VPS506 -- PRINT QUEUE IS CLOSED TO REQUESTS.  TRY AGAIN LATER.  
  
   The print queue will not accept any new print job requests.  
   To reopen the queue, the system administrator must stop  
   and then restart the print service through the MSERVICE menu.  
   After the queue is reopened, you can resubmit your print job.  
  
VPS508 -- PRINT SERVICE HAS BEEN STOPPED.  
  
   You tried to stop a printing service that was already stopped.  
  
VPS509 -- PRINT SERVICE HAS BEEN STARTED.  
  
   You tried to start a printing service that was already started.  
  
VPS510 -- YOUR JOB EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM 20 FILES.  
  
   Your print job contains too many files.  The maximum files  
   that a print job can contain is 20.  Cancel the job, reassign  
   the files, and submit the new jobs.  
  
VPS511 -- PRINT SERVICE CAN'T RECOGNIZE THE JOB'S HANDLE.  TRY AGAIN.  
  
   A reference pointer assigned to the print job (the job  
   handle) by the print service when the job was first  
   submitted cannot be read by the service.  If the print  
   service cannot locate the handle, it will not service  
   any command requests for that job.  Try again.  If this  
   error reoccurs, the job will not be serviced by the print  
   service.  The job will be removed from the print queue  
   after the timeout value for for that job is reached  
   (default is 3 minutes).  Resubmit the job.  
  
VPS513 -- PRINT SERVICE CANNOT FIND THE ERROR TRANSLATION FILE.  
  
   The file of error code translations cannot be found by  
   the print service.  If this error reoccurs, contact the  
   appropriate service personnel.  
  
VPS514 -- PRINT SERVICE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE COMMAND SENT.  
  
   The print service was sent a command from another service  
   or client that it did not recognize.  This error is unusual  
   and may indicate an internal problem.  Contact the  
   appropriate service personnel.  
  
VPS515 -- PRINT SERVICE CANNOT PROCESS THE JOB IN ITS CURRENT STATE.  
  
   This error occurs under either of two conditions:  your job  
   contains no files to be printed, or concurrent requests exist  
   for the same job.  If the job contains no files, you can cancel  
   the job and correct the problem.  In either case, resubmit the job.  
  
VPS517 -- PRINT SERVICE CANNOT ACCEPT YOUR JOB NOW.  TRY LATER.  
  
   The print service cannot process any more jobs at this time.  
   Please try again later.  If this error reoccurs, see your  
   system administrator.  
  
VPS520 -- YOUR JOB'S FORM TYPE IS UNKNOWN.  TRY AGAIN.  
  
   Your job's form type is unknown to this print service.  
   If you do not know what form type to specify, see your  
   system administrator.  The administrator enters the  
   appropriate form type for the print service through  
   MSERVICE.  
  
VPS521 -- PRINT SERVICE CONFIGURATION CANNOT BE READ.  TRY LATER.  
  
   The print service's configuration file cannot be read at  
   this time.  Try again later.  
  
VPS522 -- COMMAND USED CANNOT PERFORM THAT FUNCTION.  
  
   The command you entered cannot perform that function.  You  
   can move your job to the top of the printer queue if it is  
   not on hold or if it has been spooled.  You can restart your  
   job if it is on hold or if it has finished transferring to  
   the queue.  You can place your job on hold if it has spooled  
   and if it has finished transferring to the queue.  You can  
   cancel your job if it is on hold, spooled, or printing.  
  
STK1001 -- INCORRECT NAME SYNTAX.  
  
   Incorrect syntax appeared in a StreetTalk name.  StreetTalk  
   names can include letters, numbers, spaces, and other  
   punctuation such as periods (.), commas (,), and dashes (-).  
   Avoid other special characters, especially the at-sign (@),  
   which separates item names, group names, and organization  
   names, and the asterisk (*), which is the StreetTalk  
   wildcard character.  
  
STK1002 -- ORGANIZATION NAME TOO LONG.  
  
   Organization names cannot exceed 15 characters.  An  
   organization name is the third part of a StreetTalk name.  
   For example, in the StreetTalk name, John@dept@corp, corp  
   is the organization name.  
  
STK1003 -- GROUP NAME TOO LONG.  
  
   Group names cannot exceed 15 characters.  A group name  
   is the second part of a StreetTalk name.  For example,  
   in the StreetTalk name, John@dept@corp, dept is the  
   group name.  
  
STK1004 -- ITEM NAME TOO LONG.  
  
   Item names cannot exceed 31 characters.  An item name  
   is the first part of a StreetTalk name.  For example,  
   in the StreetTalk name, John@dept@corp, John is the  
   item name.  
  
STK1005 -- STREETTALK NAME TOO LONG.  
  
   A StreetTalk name cannot exceed 63 characters.  A  
   StreetTalk name includes an item name (maximum of 31  
   characters), a group name (maximum of 15 characters),  
   and an organization name (maximum of 15 characters).  
   A StreetTalk name can also include two at-signs (@),  
   which separate the item, group, and organization names.  
  
STK1006 -- NO MORE AVAILABLE MEMORY.  
  
   The server does not have sufficient memory to process a  
   StreetTalk request.  The request is processed as soon as  
   memory is available.  
  
STK1007 -- NAME NOT AN ORGANIZATION NAME.  
  
   The specified name is not the name of an organization.  
   Obtain the names of organizations in the network through MORG.  
  
STK1008 -- ORGANIZATION ALREADY EXISTS ON SERVER.  
  
   An organization that already exists cannot be added.  
   The organization must be unique.  
  
STK1009 -- NAME NOT A GROUP NAME.  
  
   The specified name is not the name of a group.  Obtain  
   the names of groups in the network through MORG and MGROUP.  
  
STK1010 -- GROUP ALREADY EXISTS.  SPECIFY A UNIQUE GROUP.  
  
   A group that already exists cannot be added.  The group  
   must be unique.  
  
STK1011 -- STREETTALK CANNOT FIND THIS ORGANIZATION.  
  
   Either the organization's name was typed incorrectly or  
   the organization did not exist in the network.  Retype the  
   organization's name.  
  
STK1012 -- STREETTALK CANNOT FIND THIS GROUP.  
  
   Either you have specified the group's name incorrectly,  
   the group does not exist in the network, or the server  
   on which the group is maintained is down or unreachable.  
   Retype the group's name.  If this fails, check for server  
   or network failures.  
  
STK1013 -- STREETTALK CANNOT FIND THIS NAME.  
  
   Either the name was typed incorrectly or the name  
   does not exist in the network.  
  
STK1014 -- INVALID CLASS SPECIFIED.  
  
   Three types of errors can cause this message to appear:  
  
   -   A program, such as an application written with the  
       VINES Applications Toolkit, specifies an invalid class  
       of items during a search for an item, such as a  
       StreetTalk user name.  Valid item classes include  
       users, services, lists, nicknames, aliases, and groups.  
  
   -   A program specifies a StreetTalk name that does not  
       identify an item, group, or organization in an item,  
       group, or organization name field.  
  
   -   StreetTalk receives a request from a user in a group that  
       has no associated record.  This is an internal error.  
  
STK1015 -- STREETTALK NAME EXISTS.  SPECIFY A UNIQUE NAME.  
  
   You attempted to create a StreetTalk name that already  
   existed in the network.  
  
STK1016 -- NAME IS NOT A STREETTALK NAME.  
  
   The name you specified is not a name that StreetTalk knows  
   about.  Either you typed the name incorrectly or the name  
   did not exist in the network.  Retype the name.  
  
STK1017 -- INVALID SESSION HANDLE.  
  
   This message appears when one of the following errors occurs:  
  
   -   A program attempts to access StreetTalk illegally.  
       For example, a program attempts to modify StreetTalk  
       information without the appropriate authorization.  See  
       the VINES Application Developer's Guide for information  
       on legal ways to access StreetTalk.  
  
   -   A program, such as a client, loses its session with  
       StreetTalk due to a server failure.  When the server  
       recovers, the program attempts to communicate with  
       StreetTalk using the old session handle.  A session  
       handle identifies a session.  
  
   If a client program at the PC, such as MAIL, displays this  
   error, exit from the client and run it again.  
  
STK1018 -- NAME SEARCH INCONSISTENCY.  TRY LATER.  
  
   This error message occurs during the processing of  
   StreetTalk st_enumerate calls.  This call lets clients  
   specify criteria that StreetTalk uses to search for  
   objects, such as user names.  For example, st_enumerate  
   calls can specify the pattern *@finance@corp to obtain  
   a list of all objects in the group finance@corp.  The  
   error message appears for the following reasons:  
  
   -   An error occurred during the processing of multiple requests.  
  
   -   The object being searched changed between the first  
       and final enumerate request.  
  
   -   Any objects within a StreetTalk list cannot be validated,  
       such as the name of a user that was deleted from the network.  
  
   -   A network error occurred during the search.  
  
STK1019 -- LIST CONTAINS TOO MANY MEMBERS.  
  
   The maximum number of members that can be in a list  
   was reached.  Another member cannot be added to the  
   list until an existing member is deleted.  
  
STK1020 -- ITEM IS ALREADY A MEMBER OF THIS LIST.  
  
   You cannot add an item to a list if that item is  
   already a member of the list.  
  
STK1021 -- ITEM IS NOT A MEMBER OF THIS LIST.  
  
   An error, such as a server failure, occurred during an  
   attempt to delete an item from a list.  This results  
   in corrupted StreetTalk records associated with the  
   list.  Delete the list and recreate it.  
  
STK1022 -- TOO MANY LISTS FOR STREETTALK TO SEARCH.  
  
   The maximum number of lists that StreetTalk can search  
   at once was reached.  Try again.  
  
STK1023 -- ITEM IS NOT A LIST.  
  
   The name you specified is not a list.  Use MLIST or NAMES  
   to find list names.  
  
STK1024 -- LIST SEARCH INCONSISTENCY.  TRY LATER.  
  
   This error message appears when StreetTalk resolves a list.  
   The error occurs for the following reasons:  
  
   -   StreetTalk attempted to process multiple Remote  
       Procedure Calls (RPCs), and the RPCs were not in  
       the proper sequence.  For example, when StreetTalk  
       attempted to resolve a list, it had to process three  
       RPCs.  StreetTalk received the second and third RPCs  
       but not the first.  A typical cause of this error is  
       a network failure.  
  
   -   As StreetTalk received information concerning the list,  
       it could not successfully write the information to a file  
       on disk.  
  
STK1025 -- NAME IS NOT A SERVER NAME.  
  
   The specified name is not the name of a server.  The  
   name was specified incorrectly.  
  
STK1026 -- SERVER NOT FOUND.  
  
   StreetTalk could not find the specified server.  The  
   server was specified incorrectly or network problems  
   caused the search to fail.  
  
STK1027 -- PASSWORD CANNOT EXCEED 15 CHARACTERS.  
  
   Try again with a new password that is less than 15 characters.  
  
STK1028 -- USER NAME/PASSWORD PAIR IS INVALID.  
  
   The specified user name and password did not match.  
  
STK1029 -- INVALID ASSOCIATED RECORD NUMBER SPECIFIED.  
  
   The program specified an associated record number that is  
   either not in the allowed range (001 - 999) or is within  
   the range reserved for StreetTalk (675 - 699).  This error  
   occurs as the result of an error in a program that issues  
   calls to StreetTalk.  
  
STK1030 -- ASSOCIATED RECORD HAS NO TRUE ITEM.  
  
   The associated record did not have an item such as a user  
   name.  This error typically occurs when a server failure  
   coincides with a delete operation, such as deleting a  
   user from the network.  
  
STK1031 -- ASSOCIATED RECORD TOO BIG TO ADD.  
  
   A program issued either st_addAR or st_changeAR calls to  
   StreetTalk.  The calls specified an associated record larger  
   than 1024 bytes.  
  
STK1032 -- UNKNOWN STREETTALK ERROR.  
  
   This error is caused by unusual network or server problems.  
  
STK1033 -- MODIFY ACCESS IS DENIED.  
  
   A user or program attempted to change StreetTalk  
   information without the proper authorization, such  
   as membership on the appropriate AdminList.  
  
STK1034 -- INCORRECT OPERATION INDICATOR.  
  
   A program attempted to perform an illegal operation  
   on a StreetTalk group.  Programs can only add or delete  
   groups.  All other operations are illegal.  
  
STK1035 -- TOO MANY NICKNAMES ENCOUNTERED.  
  
   The maximum number of nicknames for a user was reached.  
   Another nickname cannot be given to the user until an  
   existing one is deleted.  Use MNICK to delete nicknames  
   for a user.  
  
STK1036 -- CLASS MISMATCH BETWEEN RECORD AND INPUT PARAMETER.  
  
   A program issued a request to the StreetTalk service  
   with a record that described the requestor, but the  
   record was not of a user or of an associated record  
   of a user.  
  
STK1037 -- APPROPRIATE STREETTALK IS UNAVAILABLE.  
  
   This error occurs when the StreetTalk service on a server  
   is not running or cannot be reached due to network failures  
   or other problems.  This prevents other services on the  
   server from communicating with the rest of the network.  
   The services on the server cannot communicate until the  
   StreetTalk service on the server is started or until it  
   becomes reachable.  
  
STK1038 -- GROUP NOT FOUND ON SPECIFIED SERVER.  
  
   StreetTalk could not find a group on a server.  Either  
   the group exists on another server or it does not exist  
   at all.  
  
STK1039 -- STREETTALK UNABLE TO ANSWER REQUEST.  TRY LATER.  
  
   This error message occurs for the following reasons:  
  
   -   Two servers exchange requests for information on the  
       same group, which is in the process of being moved  
       from one of the servers.  Each server cannot answer  
       the other's request.  However, each server expects  
       the other to answer the request.  The error should  
       not occur once you complete the move.  
  
   -   The StreetTalk service issues a request for information  
       about an item's group to a StreetTalk service residing  
       on a server that is just powered on.  The service has  
       no prior knowledge of the group.  The StreetTalk service  
       on the server may not know about the group yet.  
  
   -   An attempt to power on the server on which the StreetTalk  
       service resides fails.  
  
STK1040 -- MAXIMUM # OF GROUPS PER SERVER EXCEEDED.  
  
   The maximum number of groups for this server was reached.  
   Another group cannot be added to this server until at  
   least one is deleted through MGROUP.  
  
STK1041 -- LIST OF MATCHING NAMES COMPLETE.  
  
   StreetTalk successfully processed wildcards.  For example,  
   StreetTalk was able to resolve all the names and groups  
   specified by *@*@corp.  
  
STK1042 -- LIST OF MATCHING NAMES POSSIBLY INCOMPLETE.  
  
   StreetTalk did not successfully process wildcards.  
   For example, StreetTalk was unable to resolve all the  
   names and groups specified by *@*@corp.  This error  
   occurred for the following reasons:  
  
   -   The groups specified in the wildcards were unavailable  
       due to network failures.  
  
   -   The servers that maintain the groups were not running.  
  
STK1043 -- NEW PASSWORD IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST TEN USED.  
  
   The new password must be different from the last ten passwords.  
  
STK1044 -- SECURITY RECORDS ARE NOT CONSISTENT.  
  
   This error message occurs because of a memory flushing  
   error on the StreetTalk service's server.  The error  
   modifies a user record to indicate that a security record  
   is associated with the user record.  However, no security  
   record exists.  An administrator can correct this problem  
   by creating a security record for the user through MUSER.  
   The administrator selects the user and then selects  
   "SECURITY settings."  The administrator then presses <F10>  
   to create the security record.  
  
STK1045 -- UNAUTHORIZED INTERNAL STREETTALK REQUEST.  
  
   The message appears when one of the following errors occurs:  
  
   -   A program tries to make a request to StreetTalk  
       that is reserved for the server service.  
  
   -   A program makes a request to StreetTalk that requires  
       the program to present a valid VANGuard nonce, and the  
       program fails to present the nonce.  
  
STK1046 -- READ ACCESS DENIED.  
  
   A user or program attempted to read StreetTalk information  
   without the proper authorization, such as membership on the  
   appropriate AdminList.  
  
STK1047 -- USER ACCOUNT EXPIRED.  SEE ADMINISTRATOR.  
  
   A user account expired on the expiration date that the  
   administrator set through MUSER.  
  
STK1048 -- USER ACCOUNT IS DISABLED.  SEE ADMINISTRATOR.  
  
   The administrator disabled the user account through MUSER.  
  
STK1049 -- CALLER IS NOT THE VANGUARD SERVICE.  
  
   A program issued a call to StreetTalk that is reserved  
   for the VANGuard service.  
  
STK1050 -- PASSWORD IS SHORTER THAN MINIMUM LENGTH.  SEE ADMINISTRATOR.  
  
   You cannot create a password that is shorter than  
   the minimum length.  The administrator sets the minimum  
   length for your password through MUSER.  
  
STK1051 -- NEW PASSWORD CANNOT MATCH CURRENT PASSWORD.  
  
   The PASSWORD command does not allow a user to specify the  
   current password as the new password.  The user must specify  
   a password that is different from the current one.  
  
VAN1801 -- NONCE PROVIDED IS VALID BUT NO ONE IS LOGGED IN.  
  
   The nonce for the current session is valid, but the user  
   hasn't logged in.  The VANGuard service assigns a unique  
   identifier (nonce) to a client's session with VINES.  
   The user must log in.  
  
VAN1802 -- NONCE PROVIDED IS VALID BUT PORT DOESN'T MATCH OWNER'S.  
  
   The nonce for the current session is valid, but the port  
   being used doesn't match the port that VINES assigned when  
   the current session was established.  The VANGuard service  
   assigns a unique identifier (nonce) to a client's session  
   with VINES.  
  
VAN1803 -- SYNTAX OF STREETTALK NAME IS INCORRECT.  
  
   The syntax for the StreetTalk name that you created is not  
   correct.  A StreetTalk name for an item, group, or organization  
   can use standard alphanumeric characters and some special  
   characters.  An item name can be a maximum of 31 characters.  
   A name for a group or an organization can be a maximum of 15  
   characters.  An at-sign (@) must separate an item, group, or  
   organization name.  
  
VAN1804 -- NONCE PROVIDED FOR AUTHENTICATION IS INVALID.  
  
   VANGuard cannot determine whether the nonce that it received  
   from a service is valid.  A service passes a nonce (unique  
   identifier) to the VANGuard service for validation.  The  
   VANGuard service then validates it and assigns a nonce to  
   a client's session with VINES.  
  
VAN1805 -- SERVICE ENCOUNTERED AN ERROR WHILE PARSING USER PROFILE.  
  
   When the VANGuard service compared the entries in a user  
   profile to a list of  recognized VINES keywords, it discovered  
   a keyword that it did not recognize.  Check the entries and  
   commands in the user profile.  Make sure they adhere to the  
   rules for user profiles.  
  
VAN1806 -- SERVICE IS BUSY INITIALIZING.  
  
   The VANGuard service is starting up and cannot respond to a  
   request.  Wait or enter your request again.  
  
VAN1807 -- SERVICE IS CLOSED.  
  
   The VANGuard service is not currently in operation.  
  
VAN1808 -- GROUP NAME IS TOO LONG.  
  
   The group name that you entered is too long.  A group name  
   can be a maximum of 15 characters.  
  
VAN1810 -- REQUESTED PROFILE COMMAND CANNOT BE FOUND.  
  
   The VANGuard service does not recognize a command in a user's  
   profile.  Check the spelling and syntax of the command.  All  
   profile commands are described in the VINES Command Reference.  
  
VAN1812 -- SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY REQUEST.  
  
   VANGuard cannot respond to your request at the present time.  
   Wait or enter your request at a later time  
  
VAN1817 -- INVALID USERNAME/PASSWORD WAS SPECIFIED.  
  
   Your request failed a security check.  Your password or user  
   name may be invalid.  
  
VAN1823 -- STREETTALK NAME IS TOO LONG.  
  
   You entered too many characters for a StreetTalk name.  An  
   item name can be a maximum of 31 characters.  Group and  
   organization names can be a maximum of 15 characters each.  
  
VAN1824 -- ITEM NAME IS TOO LONG.  
  
   An item name can be a maximum of 15 characters.  Check the  
   item name and enter it again.  
  
VAN1825 -- ORGANIZATION NAME IS TOO LONG.  
  
   An organization name can be a maximum of 15 characters.  
   Check the organization name that you entered.  
  
VAN1827 -- AN APPROPRIATE STREETTALK SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE.  
  
   VANGuard cannot contact a StreetTalk service that is required  
   to perform the task requested.  
  
VAN1831 -- ONLY GROUP ADMINISTRATORS CAN LOG THIS USER OUT.  
  
   You cannot log out a user if you are not an administrator of  
   that user's group.  
  
VAN1832 -- USER IS NOT CURRENTLY LOGGED IN.  
  
   You cannot log out a user who is not logged in to the network.  
  
VAN1834 -- NO LOGIN SESSIONS ARE AVAILABLE.  
  
   You cannot log in because the maximum number of users that  
   your version of VINES supports was exceeded.  You must wait  
   until a user logs out before you can log in.

VNM3001 -- INCORRECT NAME SYNTAX.  
  
   If you cannot access Mail because of this message,  
   you can try entering "whoami" at the DOS prompt to  
   verify that your login name is correct.  If the name  
   is not correct, try logging out and back in, and  
   then try to access Mail.  If this message appears  
   and you are in Mail or can access Mail, open the  
   Compose screen and check the From: field to see if  
   your login name is correct.  If the login name is not  
   correct, you can try exiting Mail, logging out and back  
   in to correct the problem.  
  
VNM3008 -- THE MESSAGE SERVICE IS NOT RESPONDING.  
  
   Mail service is not available.  Verify the status of the  
   mail service on the server on which it resides.  Either  
   the server or the mail service is down.  
  
VNM3011 -- UNEXPECTED FAILURE CONDITION.  
  
   Check the status of the services at the server console.  
  
VNM3015 -- A RECIPIENT'S ADDRESS IS INCORRECT.  
  
   The format of a recipient's address was not correct.  This  
   message usually indicates an undeliverable message.  The  
   message will be returned.  Resend it.  
  
VNM3017 -- THE SESSION HANDLE IS NO LONGER VALID.  
  
   A connection between the client and the service is  
   interrupted during the session, and you attempt  
   to access the service.  Before you can access the  
   service again at the PC, a new session should be started.  
   Try exiting the service and reentering.  If necessary,  
   try logging out and back in again.  Rebooting the PC  
   is a final option (pressing CONTROL plus ALT plus DELETE).  
  
   A session is a period of time in which the mail program in  
   your PC (also known as the "client") and the mail service  
   are logically connected and interacting.  The session handle  
   is the identifier of the current session between the mail  
   client program in the PC and the mail service.  
  
VNM3019 -- ENVELOPE FILE FOR THIS MESSAGE IS MISSING.  
  
   Users should report the appearance of this message to their  
   system administrators.  System administrators should check  
   the system carefully for configuration and connectivity  
   problems, and then contact the appropriate support personnel  
   if the problem cannot be corrected.  
  
VNM3020 -- CONTENT FILE FOR THIS MESSAGE IS MISSING.  
  
   Users should report the appearance of this message to their  
   system administrators.  System administrators should check the  
   system carefully for configuration and connectivity problems.  
   Contact the appropriate support personnel if the problem  
   cannot be corrected.  
  
VNM3025 -- PROFILE ENTRY FOR MAIL IS MISSING OR INCORRECT.  
  
   Check the user's profile.  The entry in the profile that  
   lets the user access the mail service may contain an error  
   or may be missing entirely.  
  
VNM3027 -- ATTACHMENT FILE FOR THIS MESSAGE IS MISSING.  
  
   Users should report the appearance of this message to  
   their system administrators.  System administrators  
   should check the system carefully for configuration  
   and connectivity problems.  Contact the appropriate support  
   personnel if the problem cannot be corrected.  
  
VNM3030 -- THE FOLDER ALREADY EXISTS.  
  
   You entered a folder name that already existed.  Enter a  
   different name.  
  
VNM3031 -- THE FOLDER COULD NOT BE FOUND.  
  
   You attempted to delete a folder, and the mail service  
   could not locate it.  Try again.  You may have deleted  
   the folder already.  
  
VNM3036 -- RETRY PERIOD EXPIRED.  
  
   If a user sends a message with an unverifiable  
   address, Mail will keep trying to deliver the   
   message for 7 days.  If the message cannot be   
   delivered within that period, the sender receives  
   a notice of undeliverable mail with this error code.  
  
   Check the address on the message, and make any  
   necessary corrections.  If the address appears to  
   be correct, verify that the connections to the   
   recipient are working properly and that the   
   recipient's group still exists.  
  
VNM3041 -- WRITE ERROR ON DISK.  
  
   This message appears for any one of the following  
   reasons:  the disk is full, the disk is read-only,  
   or an I/O error occurred during the attempt to  
   write the message to disk.  File the message on  
   another disk.  
  
VNM3042 -- NAME NOT FOUND.  
  
   Mail cannot deliver the message for one of the   
   following reasons:  the appropriate StreetTalk is not  
   available; the recipient's user name was deleted; the  
   recipient's name was not entered correctly.  Verify   
   the accuracy of the name entered.  If the name is   
   correct, check to see if the name was deleted.  If   
   the name is correct and exists, check the connections  
   between the recipient and the sender.  
  
VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL.  
  
   The message cannot be delivered because the  
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of   
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The  
   recipient must delete some messages before any  
   other messages can be delivered.  
     
   The default limit is 1000 messages.  Administrators   
   can set lower limits if required using the Change  
   mailbox settings function available in the Manage  
   User menu (MUSER).  The 1000 message limit is the  
   maximum allowed by the Mail program.  If this limit  
   is reached, the recipient must delete some of  
   the messages before the mailbox can accept any more  
   incoming messages.  
  
VNM3044 -- SYNTAX ERROR IN RECIPIENT LIST.  
  
   Mail could not deliver the message because of  
   a syntax error encountered in a list of  
   recipients.  The user should recover the message  
   and verify the addresses for correct syntax.  
  
VNM3045 -- MAIL SERVICE NOT FOUND.  
  
   The message could not be delivered because the   
   name of the mail service in the recipient's user   
   profile is incorrect or invalid.  Notify   
   the recipient of the problem.  
  
   The recipient's system administrator should verify   
   the name of the mail service in the user profile   
   of the recipient and make any necessary corrections.  
   If the mail service name is correct, the administrator  
   should verify the status of the mail service.  
  
VNM3046 -- WILDCARDS RESTRICTED.  
  
   This error code indicates that a recipient's  
   mailbox has been restricted from receiving mail   
   with wildcards.  
  
   If necessary, the sender can recover the   
   undelivered message and forward it to specific  
   addresses.  The system administrator can change   
   the restriction using the Change mailbox settings  
   function available in the Manage User menu (MUSER).  
  
VNM3047 -- NO MAIL SERVICE SPECIFIED IN PROFILE.  
  
   Mail could not deliver the message because  
   the appropriate SETMAIL command has not been  
   entered in the recipient's user profile.  Notify  
   the recipient of this problem.  
  
   The recipient's system administrator should verify  
   that the user profile contains the appropriate   
   SETMAIL command and mail service name.  
     
   If changes to the profile are made, the recipient  
   must log out and then log back in before Mail can  
   deliver the message.  
  
   The sender can recover the message and forward it   
   when the recipient's user profile problem has been   
   resolved.  
  
VNM3048 -- MAILBOX DISABLED.  
  
   The user's mailbox has been disabled by the system  
   administrator.  While disabled, the user cannot   
   send or receive mail.  The administrator can enable the   
   mailbox using the Change mailbox settings function  
   available in the Manage User menu (MUSER).  
  
VNM3049 -- LIST NESTING.  
  
   Mail cannot deliver the message because the   
   recipient is a list name that has more than three  
   levels of list names nested within it.  
  
   For example, a user addresses a message to   
   the list name MyList@Dept@Company (first level).    
   This list name contains the list name   
   DeptList@Dept@Company (second level).  
  
   DeptList contains the list name, VPList@Dept@Company  
   (third level).  
  
   VPList contains the list name, PRList@Mktg@Company.  
   (fourth level).  Mail cannot deliver the message  
   to MyList because of this fourth-level list name.  
  
   Remove one or more of the levels of the list nest.  
  
SER5001 -- THE ERROR CODE GIVEN IS UNKNOWN.  
  
   You supplied an unknown error code on the VNSERR command  
   line.  Known error codes begin with SER (server service),  
   STK (StreetTalk), VPS (VINES print service), VNM (VINES  
   Network Mail), and VAN (VANGuard).  
  
SER5002 -- THE SPECIFIED SERVICE IS UNKNOWN.  
  
   An entry for a service does not exist in the server  
   service svc3.db database file.  However, StreetTalk has  
   a record of this service.  The svc3.db database file may  
   have been corrupted by a system failure.  Stop and  
   restart the server service.  If the error persists, call  
   the appropriate support personnel.  
  
SER5003 -- THE REQUESTED COMMAND IS ILLEGAL.  
  
   The server service used an illegal command, resulting in a  
   severe problem.  Install the VINES software on the server again.  
  
SER5004 -- NOT ENOUGH MEMORY AVAILABLE.  
  
   The server does not have sufficient memory to process  
   a server service request, such as a request from an  
   administrator to add a service.  Try again later.  
  
SER5005 -- THE SPECIFIED PROGRAM IS NOT AVAILABLE.  
  
   This error occurs for two reasons:  
  
   -   The pgms3.db database file is corrupt.  This file  
       contains entries for all the legal service types.  If  
       the file was corrupted due to a system failure, entries  
       for some program types may be incomplete or may not  
       exist at all.  Stop and restart the server service.  
       If the error persists, the pgms3.db database file may  
       be corrupt.  In this case, install the VINES software  
       again.  
  
   -   The option associated with a service type, such as  
       Network Mail, is not enabled.  In this case, you must  
       enable the option.  
  
SER5006 -- TOO MANY PARAMETERS SUPPLIED.  
  
   MSERVICE passed the server service too many initialization  
   parameters for the service that is being created.  The  
   administrator does not have to correct this error.  
  
SER5007 -- ERROR OCCURRED WHILE INITIALIZING SERVICE.  
  
   An administrator attempted to add a service, and the  
   service creation script, that the server service uses to  
   create the service, failed.  This error indicates that  
   the service creation script may not be functioning  
   properly.  Try to add the service again.  If the error  
   persists, install VINES software on the server again.  
  
SER5008 -- STOPPING/DESTROYING THIS SERVICE IS NOT PERMITTED.  
  
   An attempt was made to stop or delete the server service,  
   StreetTalk service, or VANGuard service.  These services  
   cannot be stopped or deleted manually.  
  
SER5009 -- THE SERVICE MUST BE STOPPED.  
  
   You attempted to delete a service that is running.  Stop  
   the service before deleting it.  
  
SER5010 -- THE SERVICE ALREADY EXISTS.  
  
   You attempted to add a service with a StreetTalk name that  
   already exists.  Specify a unique StreetTalk name for the  
   service.  
  
SER5011 -- THE SERVICE IS ALREADY RUNNING.  
  
   You attempted to start a service that is already running.  
   Only stopped services can be started.  
  
SER5012 -- MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SERVICES OF THIS TYPE RUNNING.  
  
   No more services of this type can be started.  You must  
   stop a service of this type before you can start a new one.  
  
SER5013 -- NAMING SERVICE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE.  
  
   StreetTalk is not running on the server.  If the  
   StreetTalk service does not automatically start, try  
   starting the service manually.  
  
SER5014 -- UNAUTHORIZED OR INCORRECT REQUEST.  
  
   The server service cannot make a call to StreetTalk  
   successfully.  Any StreetTalk error other than  
   "STK1017 -- Invalid Session Handle" causes SER1014 to  
   appear.  Check the StreetTalk log files for more  
   information.  
  
SER5015 -- THE SPECIFIED FUNCTION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET. SORRY.  
  
   A program such as a client issues a call to the server  
   service that is not fully supported yet.  This is not  
   a serious error.  The administrator does not have to  
   correct this problem.  
  
SER5016 -- ERROR OCCURRED WHILE DESTROYING SERVICE.  
  
   An administrator attempted to delete a service, and the  
   script, that the server service uses to delete the service,  
   failed.  Try to delete the service again.  
  
SER5017 -- YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM THIS OPERATION.  
  
   You are not a member of the appropriate AdminList to  
   perform this operation.  
  
SER5018 -- THE SPECIFIED DEVICE IS CURRENTLY IN USE.  
  
   Someone attempted to start a print service that is  
   configured to use the same printer port as a print  
   service that is already running.  Two print services  
   that run concurrently cannot use the same printer port.  
  
SER5019 -- SERVER INITIALIZING.  TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO HONOR REQUEST.  
  
    Servers cannot process many kinds of requests while they  
    are initializing in the network.  The servers process  
    requests once they are initialized, that is when the  
    services on them are running.  The administrator does  
    not have to correct this problem.  
  
SER5020 -- UNABLE TO FIND SERVICE NAME IN STREETTALK (INCONSISTENT).  
  
    The server service cannot find a name of a service in  
    the StreetTalk database.  This error results from an  
    inconsistency between the server service and StreetTalk  
    databases.  Either the service does not exist in the  
    network, or the StreetTalk service on this server cannot  
    find this service due to network failures or other problems.  
  
SER5021 -- READ OF FILE SPECIFIED FAILED.  
  
   The server service could not read information from  
   a file that is installed as part of a patch.  Install  
   the patch again.  
  
SER5022 -- WRITE OF FILE SPECIFIED FAILED.  
  
   The server service could not write information to a  
   file that was installed as part of a patch.  Install  
   the patch again.  
  
SER5023 -- EXECUTION OF SHELL COMMAND FAILED.  
  
   A UNIX shell command failed to execute.  Programs such as  
   VINES logging programs that are run from MSERVICE and  
   OPERATE use a server service call to implement such  
   commands.  If this error occurs while you are performing  
   a function through a program such as MSERVICE or OPERATE,  
   try again.  If the error persists, contact the appropriate  
   support personnel.  
  
SER5024 -- SERVICE ATTRIBUTE FILE IS MISSING.  
  
   The service attributes database file,  
   /disk1/banyan/ss/SvcAttrs, is missing.  
   This file contains information about the  
   logging mask for each service.  Possible  
   causes of this error are:  
  
   -   The file was deleted due to a serious  
       system error.  
  
   -   Someone accidentally deleted the file  
       after accessing System Maintenance.  
  
SER5025 -- SERVICE ENTRY IS MISSING IN ATTRIBUTE DATABASE.  
  
   Every service requires an entry in the service attributes  
   database file, /disk1/banyan/ss/SvcAttrs.  This entry  
   includes the StreetTalk name of the service and its logging  
   mask, which can be set through MSERVICE or OPERATE.  
   Possible causes of this error include deletion of the  
   entry due to a serious system error that corrupted  
   SvcAttrs or someone accessed UNIX on the server and  
   accidentally deleted the entry when editing the file.  
  
SER5026 -- NOT ABLE TO UPDATE/INSERT A SERVICE ATTRIBUTE.  
  
   The server service cannot update the service attributes  
   database file, /disk1/banyan/ss/SvcAttrs.  The file  
   could be corrupt or the server service may not be able  
   to write to the file.  
  
SER5027 -- NOT ABLE TO FIND ATTRIBUTE.  
  
   An entry in the service attributes database file,  
   /disk1/banyan/ss/SvcAttrs, contains attribute information  
   such as the logging mask for the service.  SER5027 appears  
   when the server service cannot find this information.  
   Possible causes of this error are:  
  
   -   The entry was deleted due to a serious system error  
       that corrupted SvcAttrs.  
  
   -   Someone accessed UNIX on the server and accidentally  
       deleted the entry when editing the file.  
  
SER5028 -- MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SERVICES OF THIS TYPE CREATED.  
  
   No more services of this type can be added.  For example,  
   this error occurs when you try to create more than one  
   mail service on a server.  You must delete a service of  
   this type before you can add a new one.  
  
SER5029 -- LOCATION CODE NOT SUPPORTED ON THIS SERVER.  
  
   A client program asks the server service to translate an  
   error message in the language for which the PC running the  
   client is configured; however, the server running this server  
   service does not support the PC's language on VINES files  
   (drive Z).  A location code identifies the files on drive Z  
   that support a given language.  For example, the code USA  
   identifies the files  that support American English.  Use  
   SETDRIVE at the PC to access VINES files on a server that  
   supports the PC's language.
