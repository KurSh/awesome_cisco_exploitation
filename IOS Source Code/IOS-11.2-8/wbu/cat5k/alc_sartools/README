		Installing the LSI Software Support Package     Jul 15, 1994
			Installation Notes for V4.1_Beta


	This package currently supports the following environments,

		MIPS Workstations.
		MIPS-based DecStations.
		MIPS cross tools on a SparcStation (2.11 & 3.0).
		BSO/tasking cross tools on a SparcStation. 
		Embedded Performance tools on a SparcStation.
		
	and the following targets,

		LR3000  - 32-bit RISC processor
		LR33000	- LR3000 with on-board caches
		LR33020 - LR33000 with graphics coprocessor
		LR33050 - LR33000 with hardware floating-point 
		LR33120 - LR33000 with enhanced graphics coprocessor

	for both big and little endian byte ordering.  Use the
	`Install' program to specify the appropriate configuration.

INSTALLATION ON UNIX HOSTS

1. If you have tapes, copy the tapes into a new directory using
   the command:

	% tar xo			-- MIPS hosts
	% tar xof /dev/rst0		-- Sun hosts
	
   If you have floppy discs, copy the files into new directory, and
   then unbundle the files using the command:

	% uudecode <filename>.uu 
	% zcat <filename>.tar | tar xof -

2. Use the Install script to guide you through the installation
   process. 

	% Install

  Read and follow the instructions printed at completion of the
  installation process.

3. Source the appropriate file to set the shell's environment.

	% source source.csh		-- C Shell
	$ . dot.sh			-- Bourne Shell

4. Build the package.

	% make

The package is now ready for use. If you have the Prom Monitor source
package, you can use the package to compile and link a demonstration
program. 

	% cd examples 
	% pmcc -o game game.c

To download and execute this example program, refer to the appropriate
section of the "LR33000 MIPS PROM Monitor and C Function Run-Time
Library User's Guide".


INSTALLATION ON MSDOS HOSTS

To install and build this package on an MSDOS host, you will need a
copy of Microsoft's 'nmake' or an equivalent (nmake is supplied as
part of the Visual C++ package).

1. Copy the disks into a new directory using the command:

	C> xcopy a: /s

2. Use the 'install' script to guide you through the installation
   process. 

	C> install

  Read and follow the instructions printed at completion of the
  installation process.

3. Execute the batch file to set the shell's environment.

	C> setenv

4. Build the package.

	C> nmake		-- nmake is provided with Microsoft's C++

The package is now ready for use. If you have the Prom Monitor source
package, you can use the package to compile and link a demonstration
program. 

	C> cd examples 
	C> pmcc -o game game.c

To download and execute this example program, refer to the appropriate
section of the "LR33000 MIPS PROM Monitor and C Function Run-Time
Library User's Guide".
